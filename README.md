**Why aren't you using ES2015?**  
I like my compile times to be stupidly short, so the only babel-preset I'm using
is the react preset to support JSX

**Aphrodite and Tachyons**  
It is a bit confusing that I am essentially using two inline style methods.

Tachyons is awesome but I need certain granular styling controls for specific
positioning. So I use aphrodite inline styles for positioning, and Tachyons for
everything else.
